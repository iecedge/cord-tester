# Cord-Tester
CORD Automated Tester Suite

The CORD Automated Tester Suite (CATS) is an extensible end-to-end system test suite
targeting CORD PODs. It is typically deployed as one or more Docker containers,
either on the CORD POD or adjacent to the POD and interacts with the POD through
the PODs interfaces.

Its intended use includes:

* Regression testing for CORD related component development
* Acceptance testing of a deployed CORD POD
* Health-testing of an existing CORD POD (including non-service-impacting
  and possibly service-impacting tests)

The strength of the CATS will come from the collaboration of the whole CORD/ONOS
community, and as such we welcome contributions.
